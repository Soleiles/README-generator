## Description

In this project, we are introduced to Node.js and use it to create a functional app using the command-line terminal. Additionally, we learned to use npm as it is required for the application to work

## Installation

- Node.js v16 and Inquirer v8.2.4 are required to run this application
- Node.js can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Inquirer v8.2.4 can be downloaded using the terminal and typing `npm i inquirer@8.2.4`

## Usage

As shown in the demo, after the user types in `node index`, they are given prompts to fill out their readme files.
